## Overview

The goal of `influential` is to help identification of the most
`influential` nodes in a network as well as the classification and
ranking of top candidate features. This package contains functions for
the classification and ranking of features, reconstruction of networks
from adjacency matrices and data frames, analysis of the topology of the
network and calculation of centrality measures as well as a novel and
powerful `influential` node ranking. The **Experimental data-based
Integrative Ranking (ExIR)** is a sophisticated model for classification
and ranking of the top candidate features based on
